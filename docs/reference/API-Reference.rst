There are three APIs:

   :titlesonly:

   Type-safe API Reference (preferred, safest, and most performant API) <Type-safe-api-reference>
   Fields-based API Reference (legacy API, still supported, but not recommended for new jobs) <fields/Fields-based-API-Reference>
   What the heck is this? <fields/GroupBuilder>
   Matrix API Reference (for linear algebra operations) <Matrix-API-Reference>
