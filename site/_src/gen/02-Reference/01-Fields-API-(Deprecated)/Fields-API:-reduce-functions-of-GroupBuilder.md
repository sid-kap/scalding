### mapStream

Full access to the Iterator of values. Avoid it if you can as this cannot be optimized much

### scanLeft

A particular, but common, pattern to processes an iterator and return a new iterator.

### foldLeft

Exactly like the above, but we only keep the last value.

### reduce / mapReduceMap

Preferred operations, which are partially executed on the mappers.
